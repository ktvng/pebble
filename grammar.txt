Documentation: 
    Everything before the first line with leading character '#' is ignored

    The first section defines grammars rules. A rule will span two lines, with
    the first line starting with the symbol '@'. Individual tokens are separated
    by spaces, and all whitespace is ignored.

    The first line should be formatted
        @ [RuleName] [PrecedenceOperation] [CollapseMethod]

    where:
        [RuleName] is the name of the rule and should correspond to the atomic 
            operation (OperationTypes) expressed by the rule. 

        [PrecedenceOperation] is the operation which defines the precedence 
            class of the rule

        [CollapseMethod] defines how to merge the output of the rule back into 
            the parent operation

    The second line should be formatted
        [ProductionRule] -> ...

    Note: All production rules should begin with an uppercase


Precedence:
    The second section defines precedence classes listed from high to low.
